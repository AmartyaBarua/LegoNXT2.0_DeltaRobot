# LegoNXT2.0_DeltaRobot

This is a MATLAB program for a delta robot built using Lego NXT 2.0.
The motor input angles are calculated using the inverse kinematics function.
The program is for the delta robot only. Program to control the end-effector
is not provided as the program should change depending on the task.

## Pre-requisite

You will need the [RWTH Aachen's Toolbox](http://www.mindstorms.rwth-aachen.de/trac/wiki/Download) to control
the robot from MATLAB. Since MATLAB is an interpreted language the robot needs
to be tethered to a computer at all time.

## Note

I wrote this program back in 2011 and since then I have moved on to pursue other interests.
I probably will not update the program any more...
